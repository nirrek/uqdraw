# UQDraw
UQDraw is an active learning tool for increasing engagement during lectures. It allows lecturers to pose free-form questions to the audience, and gather real-time, hand-drawn responses from students.

The frontend is built with React + Redux + redux-saga. The backend is a GraphQL server using SQLite for persistence.

### Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nirrek/uqdraw && cd uqdraw
npm install
```

```bash
# Run the client server
npm run start
```

```bash
# Run the backend server
npm run serverDev
```
